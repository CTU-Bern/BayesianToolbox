## General notation and abbreviations

-   iid: Independent and identically distributed.
-   pdf: Probability density function. Most often denoted as $f(\cdot)$. For bivariate pdf we use the notation $f_2(\cdot)$.
-   cdf: Cumulative distribution function. Most often denoted as $F(\cdot)$. For bivariate pdf we use the notation $F_2(\cdot)$.
-   $N_2$: Bivariate cdf of the Gaussian distribution.
-   $\phi$: pdf of the standard Gaussian distribution.
-   $\Phi$: cdf of the standard Gaussian distribution.
-   $\Phi^{-1}$: Quantile function of the standard Gaussian distribution function.
