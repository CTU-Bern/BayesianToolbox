# Software and packages

Bayesian analysis faces non-trivial mathematical problems, for example, solution of integrals for posterior summaries. Likely, the most popular and convenient way to approximate complex integrals is to use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. The Bayesian Inference Using Gibbs Sampling (BUGS) software introduced in 1989 was probably one of the first software for that purpose. Since then, other software and approaches emerged allowing an accessible (for example, as R package) and user-friendly (for example, using specific syntax) for researchers. In this section we provide an overview of available statistical software for Bayesian analysis.

## Available software

### BUGS

BUGS is "Bayesian Inference Using Gibbs Sampling". BUGS used a Gibbs Sampler or the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for the simulation of posterior distributions and was likely the first accessible approach to Bayesian simulations for researchers. While WinBUGS was used in Windows systems, OpenBUGS was for Linux systems. BUGS is neither further developed nor maintained anymore.

### INLA

INLA is "Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation" ([https://www.r-inla.org/](https://www.r-inla.org/)). INLA uses latent Gaussian models for approximate Bayesian inference. INLA is an alternative to MCMC. Because of it's approximation approach it is much faster than MCMC. 

INLA interfaces with R but is not on CRAN. It can be manually installed as described on [https://www.r-inla.org/](https://www.r-inla.org/).

### JAGS

JAGS is "Just Another Gibbs Sampler" written in C++. JAGS is a dialect of the BUGS language. JAGS interfaces with R using the package **rjags**.

### Stan

"Stan is a state-of-the-art platform for statistical modeling and high-performance statistical computation." ([https://mc-stan.org/](https://mc-stan.org/)) It uses a probabilistic programming language using MCMC sampling, approximate Bayesian inference and penalized maximum likelihood estimation.

STAN interfaces with R using the package **rstan**. Regression approaches are implemented in the packages **rstanarm** and **brms**.

## Reproducibility and SCTO validation

Reproducibility of MCMC results depends on several factors (see [https://mc-stan.org/docs/reference-manual/reproducibility.html](https://mc-stan.org/docs/reference-manual/reproducibility.html)), among others,

- Operation system,
- MCMC language, interface and version,
- Versions of included libraries (Boost and Eigen),
- C++ compiler, including version, compiler flags, and linked libraries.

All above mentioned packages can be validated according to the guidelines of the SCTO validation platform ([https://swissclinicaltrialorganisation.github.io/validation_platform/](https://swissclinicaltrialorganisation.github.io/validation_platform/)).
